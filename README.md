# Draw It

This application accepts a series of continuous points captured at even time intervals by the mouse to draw a figure. Once the figure is drawn, it is recreated with the help of Fourier Transform and visualized with the help of epicycles.

## Quickstart:

1. Left click once to start drawing

2. Left click to indicate that the drawing is complete

3. Click the START button to visualize how the drawing is recreated with fourier transform

Note: If the left click is clicked after the drawing is complete, the cache is cleared and you'll have to start from the beginning.


Here's an example of the a hat.
